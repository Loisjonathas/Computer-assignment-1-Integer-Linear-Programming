The ILP solution (€995.00) is significantly higher due to the €500.00 in fixed costs (5 routes $\\times$ €100). The solver prioritizes consolidating the total shipment onto a smaller number of distinct routes (5), even if it means using routes that have slightly higher variable costs (e.g., $c_{ij}$) than the minimum possible 6 routes used in the pure LP model. The goal shifts from finding the absolute cheapest per-unit cost to finding the cheapest set of routes to open."

    "Compared to the schedule without setup times (part b), the new schedule includes sequence-dependent setup times, which change the optimal order of jobs. In part (b), the machine could switch freely between jobs because no extra time was required to change sieves. As a result, the solver simply ordered the jobs to minimize tardiness. In this part however, the model must also account for the extra time required when switching from one sieve type to another. This makes certain job sequences more expensive than others. The solver therefore prefers to group jobs with the same sieve type together, reduce the number of sieve changeovers and avoid switching back and forth between sieves. Because of this, some jobs start later than in the previous schedule and one job (job 10) becomes late, resulting in a total tardiness of 5. This lateness did not occur in part (b), where no setup times were counted. In conclusion, the introduction of setup times changes the optimal sequence: the order becomes less about due dates alone and more about finding a balance between meeting deadlines and minimizing sieve changeovers.
