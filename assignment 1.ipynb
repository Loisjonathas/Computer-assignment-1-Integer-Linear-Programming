    "The introduction of fixed costs compels the solver to adopt a different optimization strategy. The ILP solution (€850.00) is significantly higher due to the €400.00 in fixed costs (4 routes $\\times$ €100). The solver prioritizes consolidating the total shipment onto a smaller number of distinct routes (4), even if it means using routes that have slightly higher variable costs (e.g., $c_{ij}$) than the minimum possible 6 routes used in the pure LP model. The goal shifts from finding the absolute cheapest per-unit cost to finding the cheapest set of routes to open."
